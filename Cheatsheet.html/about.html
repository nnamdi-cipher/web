    </div>

      <section class="main-content" >
        <p>
          GLS Company Ltd is a subsidiary of the 3-Star group cofounded by Dennis Gideon, TImothy Paul and Nnamdi Uzoigwe.<br><br><br>

          These companies were  created during the lockdown albeit with little or no idea as to what we wanted to achieve with it.
          However, after much planning, we decided that we wanted to serve others with my little technical know-how and equally impart
          in the lives of young nigerians through the organization of tutorials, webinars and scholarships in collaboration with the 
          Omonijo foundation and Gideon Tuchel Group which is a multi-million dollar company.<br><br><br><br>
          
              Our last webinar was on the 21st of February, 2031 which had in total 2000 persons in attendance and receive wide publicity.
              Participants were trained in various areas of their choice such as Web development, App Development, Use of Microsoft Office,
              Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, Forex Trading, Copywriting and Safety Education. Our top five students in each field were
              rewarded with $5,000 each thanks to Prof. Adelabu Omonijo's foundation for their start-ups. <br><br><br><br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
